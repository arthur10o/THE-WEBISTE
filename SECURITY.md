## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of our project is a priority. If you discover a vulnerability, we strongly encourage you to let us know so that we can fix it quickly.
Please report any security vulnerabilities via our secure reporting form: [GitHub Security page](https://github.com/arthur10o/THE-WEBISTE/security/advisories/new)
### What you can expect
🔐 Your report will be treated confidentially.

📬 You will receive confirmation of receipt within [24/48 hours].

🔄 We will keep you informed of the progress of the investigation, with regular updates (usually every [1 to 2 weeks], depending on the severity).

✅ If the vulnerability is confirmed, a fix will be implemented as soon as possible, followed by a security release or update.

❌ If the report is rejected (false alarm, expected behaviour, etc.), you will receive a clear and justified explanation.


⚠️ Please do not publicly disclose details of a vulnerability until a patch has been released, in order to protect users.
